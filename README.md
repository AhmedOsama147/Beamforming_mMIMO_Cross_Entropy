Abstract
Massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems are a promising technology for the next generations of wireless communication systems. The precoders
designed in such systems are hybrid digital/analog precoders to reduce the cost and power consumption compared to fully digital precoders. In this project, an algorithm based on the estimation minimization machine learning technique is proposed to design the hybrid precoder. Assuming the knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and receiver, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides higher spectral and energy efficiencies than well-known algorithms in the literature, such as: Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and Alternative Minimization Algorithm using Phase Extraction (PE-AltMin).
